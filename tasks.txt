I need to finish the updated view
	> BlueprintOverview -> CurrentProject -> "Canvas" -> Scenes -> Blocks
		> Blocks Header gets a new span with a close / bin icon, to delete that said block

I also need to add the CRUD functionality for the blueprint view
	> DblClick on Canvas -> Create new Block
	> Delete
	> DblClick on Block -> Show Edit Form
